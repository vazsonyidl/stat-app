# StatApp

This project created by Daniel Vazsonyi to display statistical data about Estonian counties.

# Start-up

You can serve the UI from `client` folder with `ng serve` and the backend for the app from `server` folder with node `server.js`.

# Final note

This project was created for learning purposes. This project is not done yet and there are a lot space to improve.

I will get back to polish my unit testing skills as well. 

Some of the counties are missing, but I will add them soon. :)
